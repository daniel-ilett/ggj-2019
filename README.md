# Roomy Woomy
A game made for Global Game Jam 2019 (What Home Means to You).

## Overview
The game is about all of the objects you can find in my room, and what they each mean to me. Gameplay is similar to a point-and-click, although an item only becomes highlighted once you mouse-over it. When an item is selected, the game exposes some dialogue related to that item, and what the item means to me.

## Design and Aesthetic
I decided to adopt a monochrome theme (using black fineliner to draw each item) so that the scene is not overly complicated. It also results in a somewhat striking aesthetic.

The text is all delivered through my own handwriting because I wanted to convey the idea that I'm talking to the player directly. My handwriting is a little untidy in places, which is intended to signify the difficulty in expressing ideas to others.

I'd liked to have delivered more fully fleshed-out stories related to each item, but some are perhaps too personal.

Thanks for playing my games.
